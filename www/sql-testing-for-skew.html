            <h2>Setup</h2>

            <p>StreamBuster is in fiscal planning season and word has gotten out that the average payment for a rental over the last month was $8.30!  The company plans to double rentals from 182 a month to 364 rentals a month, and everyone is talking about how the revenue target for the sales team is going to be an eye popping $3,021.20 <code>$8.30 * 364</code> for the next month.</p>

            <blockquote>See <a href="writing-sql-tests.html">the SQL Testing Framework 101 tutorial</a> for database setup instructions to follow along on your computer.<br/>

            <span>For this example we'll also need to modify one of the records:</span>
<pre><code>UPDATE payment SET amount = 999 WHERE payment_id = (
    SELECT MAX(payment_id) FROM payment
)
</code></pre>
            </blockquote>

            <p>You're cleaning out the dust from between your keys, when you see a message from your boss, Sandy Holcombs.  Sandy leads sales at StreamBuster.</p>

            <pre style="white-space: pre-line;">
> Sandy Holcombs is typing...
> Hey there! We have a big number to hit. I was think we should lean in to the most frequently rented titles. If we can double those at $8.30 per rental, then we should be able to hit the sales goal.  Can you run a report for me that shows the best sellers?  Thanks!!!
            </pre>

            <p>Sounds easy enough.  Let's write the query:</p>

            <h2>Get to work</h2>

<pre><code>\set current_date 2006-02-14
SELECT
   film.title
  ,COUNT(film.title) AS rental_count
  ,SUM(payment.amount) AS revenue
FROM rental
JOIN inventory USING(inventory_id)
JOIN film USING(film_id)
JOIN payment USING(rental_id)
WHERE rental_date > :'current_date'::date - 30
GROUP BY film_id
ORDER BY rental_count DESC
LIMIT 1
;

    title    | rental_count | revenue
-------------+--------------+---------
 Shock Cabin |            2 |    5.98
(1 row)
</code></pre>

            <p>Alright, "Shock Cabin", you're about to receive all of the promotional might that Sandy's team can muster.</p>

            <p>Wait a minute, the revenue-per-unit on Shock Cabin, <code>$5.98 / 2 = $2.99</code>, is far less than the $8.30 Sandy was talking about.  She is not going to be happy.</p>

            <p>Let's write some tests, to make sure that we didn't make a mistake.</p>

<pre><code>\set current_date 2006-02-14
:setup_test
WITH text AS (
  SELECT 'Shock Cabin is less than $4.00 per rental' AS value
), expect AS (
  SELECT 0 AS value
), shock_cabin AS (
  SELECT
     rental.rental_id AS rental_id
    ,SUM(payment.amount) AS payment_amounts
  FROM film
  JOIN inventory USING(film_id)
  JOIN rental USING(inventory_id)
  JOIN payment USING(rental_id)
  WHERE film.title ILIKE '%SHOCK CABIN%'
    AND rental_date > :'current_date'::date - 30
  GROUP BY rental.rental_id
), precheck_there_are_two_rentals AS (
  -- It's a good idea to check that the 2 records we assume are there
  INSERT INTO :"prechecks" (value)
  SELECT COALESCE(COUNT(rental_id) = 2, FALSE)
  FROM shock_cabin
), actual AS (
  SELECT
    COUNT(*) AS value
  FROM shock_cabin
  WHERE payment_amounts > 4.00
)
:evaluate_test
:cleanup_test
</code></pre>

<pre><code> actual | expect | did_pass |                   text
--------+--------+----------+-------------------------------------------
 0      | 0      | true     | Shock Cabin is less than $4.00 per rental
(1 row)
</code></pre>

            <p>Looks like, Shock Cabin never rented for more than $4.00, so each rental must have been less than $8.30.  I wonder why the average payment per rental Holcombs was talking about is so much higher?</p>

            <h2>On average, averages are bad</h2>

            <p>Sometimes we get results that are "correct" but that lead to bad decision making because of skew in the data.  Averages are very susceptible to this:</p>

<pre><code>1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 100</code></pre>

<p>The average is <code>12</code>.  But if you're pulling numbers out of a random hat, you will never get a <code>12</code>.  You'll either get <code>1</code>, or a <code>100</code>, no matter what, you'll be off by an order of magnitude if you were expecting to pull a <code>12</code>.</p>

            <p>Non-bell-curve, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_law">power law distributions</a> (also called a long-tail) like this are really common with real world data.</p>

            <p>In addition to the fact that the average is no where near the real numbers in the population, in the real world, with some cleverness, you can usually think of a way to create selection bias so that if you want just a <code>1</code> or just a <code>100</code>s you can greatly increase your odds of getting either just <code>1</code> or just <code>100</code>.  Imagine these are stones that weigh 1 gram or 100 grams, when you reach into the hat, it will be very easy to pick a big one or one of the small ones.</p>

            <p>Before doing a roll-up like a <code>SUM</code> or an <code>AVERAGE</code> in a query, it's a really good idea to check for skew in the data, so you don't get fooled into thinking that the world is average.</p>

            <h2>Skew Precheck</h2>

            <p>Back at StreamBuster, you're starting to suspect that there are some high-dollar rentals skewing the average payment per rental.  There was that one time when we had Wu-Tang Clan's, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Once_Upon_a_Time_in_Shaolin">Once Upon a Time in Shaolin</a> in inventory.</p>

            <p>SQL Testing Framework has a simple way to guard against skew in the data by using a special type of precheck assertion:</p>

<pre><code><span class="highlight">\set mad_max_tbl payment</span>
<span class="highlight">\set mad_max_col amount</span>
:setup_test
WITH text AS (
  SELECT 'A sample test with skew precheck' AS value
), expect AS (
  SELECT TRUE AS value
<span class="highlight">), mad_max AS (</span>
<span class="highlight">  -- one row with `mad` and `max` columns</span>
<span class="highlight">  -- `mad` is the median absolute deviation</span>
<span class="highlight">  -- `max` is 6 mad deviations from the median</span>
<span class="highlight">  -- anything outside of that is probably an outlier</span>
<span class="highlight">  :get_mad_max</span>
<span class="highlight">), precheck_no_skew AS (</span>
<span class="highlight">  INSERT INTO :"prechecks" (value)</span>
<span class="highlight">  SELECT COALESCE(COUNT(amount) = 0, FALSE)</span>
<span class="highlight">  FROM payment</span>
<span class="highlight">  FULL JOIN mad_max ON TRUE</span>
<span class="highlight">  WHERE payment.amount > mad_max.max + mad_max.mad</span>
), actual AS (
  SELECT TRUE AS value
)
:evaluate_test
:cleanup_test
</code></pre>

            <p>The new concepts are in <span class="highlight">highlight</span>.  Let's break it down:</p>

            <p>In the first part, we need to tell SQL Testing Framework what table and column should be checked for skew.  This is done by setting the <code>mad_max_tbl</code> and <code>mad_max_col</code> variables.</p>

<pre><code>\set mad_max_tbl payment
\set mad_max_col amount
</code></pre>

            <p>Next, we create a common table expression to hold the results of the skew calculation, and insert the variable <code>:get_mad_max</code> to populate it.</p>

<pre><code>
), mad_max AS (
  -- one row with `mad` and `max` columns
  -- `mad` is the median absolute deviation
  -- `max` is 6 mad deviations from the median
  -- anything outside of that is probably an outlier
  :get_mad_max
),
</code></pre>

            <p>Finally, we follow the usual <a href="/precheck-assertions-for-sql-queries.html">precheck assertion</a> pattern, but use our access to <code>mad_max.max</code> and <code>mad_max.mad</code> to decide if the amount of skew is acceptable.</p>

<pre><code>
), precheck_no_skew AS (
  INSERT INTO :"prechecks" (value)
  SELECT COALESCE(COUNT(amount) = 0, FALSE)
  FROM payment
  FULL JOIN mad_max ON TRUE
  WHERE payment.amount > mad_max.max + mad_max.mad
)
</code></pre>

            <h2>Mad Max: no, not the movie</h2>

            <p>A little statistics background to help your understanding.  A conventional way to judge variability in a dataset is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation">standard deviation</a>.  Most databases have the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/functions-aggregate.html#:~:text=the%20dependent%20variable)-,stddev(expression),-smallint%2C%20int">built-in aggregate functions to calculation standard deviation.</a>  The manufacturing concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Sigma">six sigma</a> would then say that if there are six standard deviations between the average and the upper/lower specification limit, then a manufacturing process is in good control.</p>

            <p>Borrowing those concepts for evaluating skew, we could say that if all of our data points fall within 6 standard deviations from the average, then there can't be any extreme outliers. However, this requires using averages (standard deviation itself is the average deviation).</p>

            <p>To stay away from averages, we use the same concepts, but with the median instead of the average, so we get <strong>median absolute deviation (MAD)</strong>, which represents one-unit of deviation and <strong>maximum deviation</strong>, which SQL Testing Framework defaults to 6 median absolution deviations <strong>(6-mad)</strong>.</p>

            <p>These concepts show up in the last line of our precheck assertion:</p>

<pre><code>), precheck_no_skew AS (
  INSERT INTO :"prechecks" (value)
  SELECT COALESCE(COUNT(amount) = 0, FALSE)
  FROM payment
  FULL JOIN mad_max ON TRUE
<span class="highlight">  WHERE payment.amount > mad_max.max + mad_max.mad</span>
)
</code></pre>

            <p>We checking for <code>payment.amount</code> values that are greater than 7 median absolute deviations (the 6 default <code>mad</code>s in <code>max</code> plus one more) from the median.</p>

            <h2>Finding the skew</h2>

            <p>Adding this to your tests, we see that there is indeed a skew problem:</p>

<pre><code>\set current_date 2006-02-14
<span class="highlight">\set mad_max_tbl payment</span>
<span class="highlight">\set mad_max_col amount</span>
:setup_test
WITH text AS (
  SELECT 'Shock Cabin is less than $4.00 per rental' AS value
), expect AS (
  SELECT 0 AS value
), shock_cabin AS (
  SELECT
     rental.rental_id AS rental_id
    ,SUM(payment.amount) AS payment_amounts
  FROM film
  JOIN inventory USING(film_id)
  JOIN rental USING(inventory_id)
  JOIN payment USING(rental_id)
  WHERE film.title ILIKE '%SHOCK CABIN%'
    AND rental_date > :'current_date'::date - 30
  GROUP BY rental.rental_id
), precheck_there_are_two_rentals AS (
  -- It's a good idea to check that the 2 records we assume are there
  INSERT INTO :"prechecks" (value)
  SELECT COALESCE(COUNT(rental_id) = 2, FALSE)
  FROM shock_cabin
<span class="highlight">), mad_max AS (</span>
<span class="highlight">  :get_mad_max</span>
<span class="highlight">), precheck_no_skew AS (</span>
<span class="highlight">  INSERT INTO :"prechecks" (value)</span>
<span class="highlight">  SELECT COALESCE(COUNT(amount) = 0, FALSE)</span>
<span class="highlight">  FROM payment</span>
<span class="highlight">  FULL JOIN mad_max ON TRUE</span>
<span class="highlight">  WHERE payment.amount > mad_max.max + mad_max.mad</span>
), actual AS (
  SELECT
    COUNT(*) AS value
  FROM shock_cabin
  WHERE payment_amounts > 4.00
)
:evaluate_test
:cleanup_test
</code></pre>

<pre><code> actual | expect | did_pass |                   text
--------+--------+----------+-------------------------------------------
<span class="failing-test"> 0      | 0      | f-pre    | Shock Cabin is less than $4.00 per rental</span>
(1 row)
</code></pre>

            <p>That's great to know, but not that helpful on it's own.  Where is the outlier?  How big is it?</p>

            <p>To diagnose skew issues, SQL Testing Framework as some additional tools.  Launch a connection to your database so we can see what's going on:</p>

<pre><code>postgres=# \set mad_max_tbl payment
postgres=# \set mad_max_col amount
postgres=# \include test/utils/histogram.sql

         label         |       value

 max                   |               999
 stddev_pop            | 8.567842706195115
 median                |              3.99
 MAD                   |                 1
                       |
 -0.009999999999999787 |                24
 0.9900000000000002    |              2721
 1.9900000000000002    |               580
 2.99                  |              3240
 3.99                  |               988
 4.99                  |              3431
 5.99                  |              1188
 6.99                  |              1022
 7.99                  |               622
 8.99                  |               439
 9.99                  |               341
(17 rows)
</code></pre>

            <p><code>test/utils/histogram.sql</code> provides some useful statistics, as well as the bucketization of values in the 6-mad calculation (there are 341 payments of $9.99 or more).  We can also see that the maximum payment is <strong>$999</strong>  It looks like StreamBuster did rent THE WU after all and it's pulling the average way up.</p>

            <h2>Bad news for Holcombs</h2>

            <p>This is bad news for Sandy.  It means she's going to have to either find some more whales to rent THE WU at $999, or rent 757 <code>($3,021.20 / $3.99)</code> units at (the more likely) mean payment per rental ($3.99)- almost twice the amount of work she was expecting. 💀</p>
